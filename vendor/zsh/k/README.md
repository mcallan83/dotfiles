## Directory listings for zsh with git features

**k** is a zsh script / plugin to make directory listings more readable, adding a bit of color and some git status information on files and directories.

### Git status on entire repos

### Git status on files within a working tree

### File weight colours
Files sizes are graded from green for small (< 1k), to red for huge (> 1mb).

**Human readable files sizes**  
Human readable files sizes can be shown by using the `-h` flag, which requires the `numfmt` command to be available. OS X / Darwin does not have a `numfmt` command by default, so GNU coreutils needs to be installed, which provides `gnumfmt` that `k` will also use if available. GNU coreutils can be installed on OS X with [homebrew](http://brew.sh):

```
brew install coreutils
```

We'd like to make this POSIX compliant so that it can be used with bash and other shells. But don't really know anything about shell scripting, so if you think you could help that would be coooool :)
